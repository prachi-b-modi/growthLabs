## Overview

GrowthLabs is an intelligent platform that automatically detects drops in user engagement and provides data-driven recommendations for recovery through A/B testing. The platform creates a complete feedback loop from detection to implementation, leveraging multiple AI and ambient agents and APIs for comprehensive growth optimization.

## How It Works

### üîç **Engagement Detection**
- Monitors user engagement metrics using **Mixpanel** and **Arcade.dev**
- Automatically detects significant drops in user activity and engagement patterns
- Triggers alerts when engagement falls below predefined thresholds

### üåê **Web Intelligence Gathering**
- Scrapes relevant web insights using **Bright Data's Reddit Discovery API**
- Collects real-time user sentiment and feedback from social platforms
- Gathers competitive intelligence and market trends

### üìä **Sentiment Analysis**
- Processes collected data through **Senso API** for advanced sentiment analysis
- Identifies key pain points and user satisfaction trends
- Provides actionable insights from user feedback

### üß™ **A/B Experiment Design**
- Leverages **LLM-powered experiment designer** to generate hypothesis-driven A/B tests
- Creates targeted experiments based on detected engagement drops
- Optimizes test parameters for maximum impact

### üîÑ **Human-in-the-Loop Validation**
- Integrates human validation for experiment approval and refinement
- Ensures quality control and business alignment
- Maintains oversight while automating routine tasks

### üöÄ **Automated Implementation**
- **Slack integration** for team notifications and experiment updates
- **Jira integration** for seamless project management and task tracking
- Automated deployment of approved experiments

## Architecture

The platform consists of multiple specialized AI agents:


- **Bright Data Agent**: Handles web scraping and data collection
- **Senso AI Agent**: Performs sentiment analysis and user feedback processing
- **Arcade Agent**: Monitors and analyzes user engagement metrics
- **LLM Agent**: Generates and optimizes A/B test hypotheses
- **Ambient Agent**: Provides continuous monitoring and automated decision making
- **Orchestrator**: Coordinates all agents and manages the overall workflow

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Python with multiple AI agents
- **Analytics**: Mixpanel for user engagement tracking
- **Data Collection**: Bright Data APIs for web scraping
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Senso API
- **Integration**: Slack and Jira APIs
- **Deployment**: Vercel
